This plugin adds the ability to add more social icons to your website when using the Divi theme.

== Description ==
This plugin was made to easily add more social icons to your Wordpress websites when using the [Divi theme](https://www.elegantthemes.com/gallery/divi/). By default Divi only supports 5 icons (Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Instagram, RSS).
The latest test was run with WordPress 6.2 and Font Awesome 4.3.2, however, it should also work with older versions.

This plugin enables the following icons:
- WhatsApp
- Facebook
- Twitter
- X (Twitter)
- Bluesky
- LinkedIn
- YouTube
- Vimeo
- Medium
- Tumblr
- Pinterest
- Instagram
- Snapchat
- Telegram
- TikTok
- Twitch
- Periscope
- SoundCloud
- Spotify
- Apple
- Xing
- Behance
- Dribbble
- Flickr
- GitHub
- Discord
- Houzz
- RSS

### Usage

After activating the plugin, you will see a 'Social Icons' tab in the 'Theme options' of Divi.
You will be able to enable icons like you would normally do with the default icons.
